# Invidious-Preferences-Userscript
This Userscript (compatible with browser extensions such as Tampermonkey) is for enforcing universal Invidious preferences through URL Parameters. 

To install it, go [here](https://github.com/MintMain21/Invidious-URL-Parameters-Userscript/blob/main/In)vidious-Preferences.js) and click "raw". If you are not automatically taken to a install page, you can right-click and choose "select all", right-click and choose "copy", and then paste it as a new userscript in Tampermonkey (or whatever you use). 

To change the settings enforce, all you need to do is change the settings string. For more information about URL Parameters, see [here](https://docs.invidious.io/url-parameters/)

It is recommended that you use this script in combination with https://github.com/dybdeskarphet/privacy-redirector and https://codeberg.org/mthsk/userscripts/src/branch/master/simple-sponsor-skipper
